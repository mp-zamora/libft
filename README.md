# Libft
The libft project is the first one from the 42 Cursus. It consists on the implementation of basic functions to use in future projects, as the use of external libraries is extremely limited at 42. For this reason, the creation of a custom basic library is the fisrt step in the 42 journey.

## About my implementation
The current implementation of the different functions that compose the libft project is from a year ago, with the exception of some recent modifications to adapt to the needs of the push_swap project. Thus, the files present in this repository do not demonstrate my current level, nor they are 100% accuarate to the project's subject.

### TODO
Because of what I explained in the last paragraph, a rework of the libft is needed. In this rework I also have the intention to include more custom functions and other projects such as get_next_line that, I feel, will be useful for the future.
